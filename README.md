Given a list of cable lengths, this function computes the minimum total cost to connect all the cables into one single cable using the min-heap approach.

The cost of connecting two cables is the sum of their lengths.
    
The function uses a min-heap to always connect the two shortest cables first to minimize the total cost. It also prints the details of each connection step.
